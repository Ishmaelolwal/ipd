# EECS 495 Intensive Program Design

We will use this repository to develop and publish lecture notes and
other course materials, as appropriate. This means that you, the
student, can make suggestions or corrections by way of a [pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). (It
also gives you a chance to take a peek at our development process.)
