The City of Chicago regulates taxi fares, setting two kinds of rates:
there are meter fares for most pickups, and flat-rate fares for known
distances such as rides from hotels to the airport. The meter rates
are set as follows: The base fare for any ride is $3.05, and it costs
$1.80 per mile of travel.

How much does a 0.5 mi. ride cost? How about 1 mi.? 2 mi.?

Make a table that  shows the fare for distances of 0.5  mi., 1 mi, 1.5
mi, 2 mi., 2.5 mi., 3 mi. Use the format of the table as in the NASA space
probe part of the question.

Create a formula for calculating fares from trip distances.

Use the formula to design a function that computes a taxi fare given
the distance traveled.

The NASA space probe New Horizons, en route to Pluto, stalled while
passing Jupiter. Objects falling on Jupiter accelerate at 23 m/s2,
like this:

after t =	0	1	2	3	4	...	10	...	15	seconds
it has traveled	0.0	11.5	46.0	103.5	184.0	...	??	...	??	meters

Guess a formula for calculating how far New Horizons will fall in t
seconds. (For physicists: ignore the change in gravity that results
from changing elevation, as well as other complications.)

Check the formula for the first five table entries. If the formula
doesnâ€™t work, guess again until you find one that does.

Once the formula works for the first five entries, use it to design a
function that computes the distance traveled given the time elapsed in
seconds.

To supplement my meager teaching income, I shovel snow for some of my
neighbors. For shoveling a sidewalk and driveway, I charge each
neighbor $10 per job plus $5 per inch of snowfall to be shoveled.

How much do I get paid if I shovel for one neighbor after a storm that
drops 1 inch of snow? What if 4 neighbors hire me after a blizzard
puts down 14 inches?

Make a table that shows my income in terms of both inches of snow and
the number of neighbors that hire me. (The table should have at least
9 values.)

Create a formula for calculating how much I earn if I shovel d inches
of snow for each of n neighbors.

Use the formula to design a function that computes my snow shoveling
income given both the number of inches and number of neighbors.
