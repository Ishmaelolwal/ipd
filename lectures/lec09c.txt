Alright, lets try do something useful with this. Lets say that we
wanted to maintain a phonebook database with functions that have these
contracts:

;; add : String Number -> void
;; EFFECT: updates the database to record a new name

;; lookup : String -> Number or #false
;; returns the number of a person in the database, if they are there

With these contracts, we see that there is no actual database
mentioned anywhere. Why would this be useful to someone actually
programming?

Well, one reason is that you are building the back end to some web or
GUI interface and these are the functions that correspond to clicks in
the website (and this website isn't implemented using 2htdp/universe
-- or, perhaps you are implementing 2htdp/universe!)

[ Design the needed data definitions and implement these functions ]
