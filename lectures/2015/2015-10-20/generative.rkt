  Problems:

    - bisection method

    - merge sort 

    - Graph problems/algorithms:
        - BFS
        - DFS
        - generic graph search

In numerical analysis, the bisection method finds a zero of a function by
performing binary search on some span of it in which a zero is guaranteed
to exist. If we have a continuous function f that is negative at some point x0
and positive at some point x1, then there is a zero somewhere in between.

Without loss of generality, let x0 < x1, f(x0) < 0, and f(x1) > 0. Then the
let the halfway point p = (x0 + x1)/2. Then one of:

  - p = 0, so p is the zero
  - p < 0, so there's a zero in interval (p, x1)
  - p > 0, so there's a zero in interval (x0, p)

That is, given an interval with a zero, we can transform it into a smaller
problem--an interval half the size. Thus we can make the interval arbitrarily
small via generative recursion.

;; [Number -> Number] Number Number PositiveNumber -> Number
;; Approximates the zero of a function by finding a result x such that
;; |f(x)| â‰¤ delta.
;;
;; PRECONDITION: f(x0) < 0 and f(x1) > 0.
;;
;; Examples:
;;
;;  - if f(x) = x, interval (-1, 1), any delta, result should be 0
;;  - if f(x) = x, interval (-1, 3), any delta, result should be 0
;;  - if f(x) = x, interval (-1, 2), delta = 0.2, result should be 0.125
;;  - if f(x) = x, interval (-1, 2), delta = 0.1, result should be -0.0625
;;  - if f(x) = 2x, interval (-1, 2), delta = 0.2, result should be -0.0625
;;
;; Strategy: generative recursion
;; Termination argument: Assuming f is not pathological (?), as p approaches
;; the actual zero, f(p) approaches 0. Each subproblem moves one bound or the
;; other closer to the actual zero, which means that the bounds close in on it,
;; which means that p closes in on it, which means that f(p) approaches 0,
;; which means it will be less than delta at some point.
