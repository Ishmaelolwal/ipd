# IPD Style Rules

## Naming

  - If the homework assignment specifies a function name, you *must* use
    that function name.

## Code formatting

  - Lines must be at most 80 characters long.

      - Longer lines must be broken; insert line breaks where you think
        they will maximize readability.

      - DrRacket can help you with this. In *Preferences*, go to the
        *Editing* section, and select “Maximum character width guide”
        with a width of 80. This will cause DrRacket to draw a right
        margin in your editor window.

  - In function definitions, a mandatory line break follows the function
    name and arguments list:

    Bad:
    ```racket
    (define (my-function arg1 arg2) function-body-stuff)
    ```

    Good:
    ```racket
    (define (my-function arg1 arg2)
      function-body-stuff)
    ```
